            <div class="text-content clearfix field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>For Drupal 8, <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/module_builder">Module Builder</a> is undergoing some big changes. It still builds hooks, a README file, an api.php file, permissions, an admin settings form, but now also builds plugins, services, routing items, and its ability to scan your codebase to learn about hooks invented by any of your modules is now extended to plugin types too. And it's actually been available for Drupal 8 for quite some time, but up till now only as the Drush plugin version.</p>
<p>I've now released the D8 version of the module, so you can use an admin UI in Drupal which lets you select the components you want in a form. Unlike Drupal 7 though, the options you enter for your module to generate are stored in a config entity, so you can generate code and then go back and tweak the settings and generate it again, as often as you like.</p>
<p>The big change isn't any of these though. The big change is that Module Builder is being split up.</p>
<p>For a very long time, the Module Builder codebase has been three things in one. Back when I added Drush support (in 2009, according to the git log), it made sense to gradually refactor the code into three parts: the Drupal module UI, the Drush commands, and the common code that does the actual work of generating code based on some parameters (such as which hooks you want, the module name, etc).</p>
<p>That core code has undergone a lot of changes. It's gone from just working with hooks, to a framework that's extensible with new component types. So for example, it's possible to request simply 'an admin form', and the generating code knows to produce the code for the form, the admin permission, and the router item. So that's one component that in fact produces form functions, hook_permission(), hook_menu() on Drupal 7, form class, permissions.yml, routing.yml on Drupal 8. Because Module Builder also works on multiple versions of Drupal (the code to produce Drupal 5 code is even still in there, if you have cause to try it, let me know if it still works!).</p>
<p>Having this multiple-version code within a Drupal module that's only for single version is a source of problems and confusion. The 7.x-2.x version of the project contains a module that's only for Drupal 7, but also the core code and the Drush plugin that both work on all versions. It also increases maintenance work, if we want to the older versions to keep receiving improvements to the generating code.</p>
<p>Hence the split. Module Builder is being divided into three parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>The core code of Module Builder has been moved to a separate library, which is called Drupal Code Builder to distinguish it.</li>
<li>The Module Builder project is from now on just Drupal module, which requires the Drupal Code Builder library.</li>
<li>The Drush plugin will be moving too, and will also require the Drupal Code Builder library.</li>
</ul>
<p>So to summarize, the situation is now as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>To build modules in a Drupal UI, on Drupal 8, you need:
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/module_builder">Module Builder 8.x-3.x</a> (see the README for instructions)</li>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/drupal-code-builder/drupal-code-builder">Drupal Code Builder library</a>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>To build modules with Drush, on any version, you need:
<ul>
<li>Module Builder 7.x-2.x, installed as a Drush command plugin (again, see the README). But note this will shortly be changing when the Drush command moves out of the d.org project too.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>To build modules in a Drupal UI, on Drupal 7, you need:
<ul>
<li>Module Builder 7.x-2.x. I will probably release a 7.x-3.x at some point which requires the Drupal Code Builder library, so that the Drupal 7.x UI gets new features that are released in the library.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I'll be writing a post soon about how Drupal Code Builder works, so if you're interested in making Drupal Code Builder make something new, look out for that.</p></div>

            <div class="text-content clearfix field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>Migrate module makes the assumption that for each item in your source, you're importing one item into Drupal, and that's baked in pretty deep.</p>
<p>So how do you handle source items where there is body text containing multiple inline images, which should be imported to file entities? For each single source item, ultimately imported as a node, you also have a variable number of images: a one-to-many source to destination relationship.</p>
<p>One way is to simply import the image files at the same time as the nodes whose body text they are in. In the prepareRow() method of your migration class, you effectively do a mini-import, analysing the text, fetching the file data, saving the file locally, and then getting a file ID that you can use to replace into the body text. But doing that, you don't benefit from any of Migrate's helper classes for importing files, nor can you roll these back without writing further code: this isn't a Migration, capital M, it's just an import.</p>
<p>The better way is to write a second migration, to run before your node migration. It may seem like extra work to have to write a second migration class, but it pays off, and besides, since they both draw from the same source data, a lot of your code is already written. Copy-paste the class definition and the constructor as far as the field mappings. The code you would have put in prepareRow() to analyse the text goes somewhere else, but we're getting ahead of ourselves.</p>
<p>And it turns out that Migrate does allow for your single source items to yield multiple destination items: tucked away in the module's source classes and not mentioned in the examples (which do cover a great deal, are probably the most extensive examples of any contrib module all the same, it must be said) there are at least two (that I've found) places where the one-to-one correspondence can be skirted around.</p>
<p>The one that I used is only available when you use the MigrateSourceList source type, and furthermore when your list source is a set of files. As it happened, the source data I was working with on my project came in JSON files, one file per node to import, and with a body text field which contained references to image files which also needed to be imported.</p>
<p>MigrateSourceList is a source type that separates out the two concepts of listing your source items and processing each one. So unlike, say, the CSV source where the list and the item processing are both provided by the one class, with MigrateSourceList, you can say something like 'my list source is a directory listing, and each item is a JSON file', or 'my list source is a JSON file, and each item is an HTML file'. The MigrateSourceList class delegates the two jobs to further classes, which allows you to mix and match them. Your migration specifies them in the constructor:</p>
<pre><code>    $this-&gt;source = new MigrateSourceList(new MigrateListFiles($list_dirs, $base_dir),
      new MigrateItemFile($base_dir), $fields);
</code></pre>
<p>There's one more component in the system, and this is the crucial piece that allows us to have more than one destination item per source item: it's the MigrateContentParser class. This allows the files that MigrateListFiles to each return multiple items to MigrateSourceList.</p>
<p>The only implementation of this in Migrate is MigrateSimpleContentParser, which doesn't do much, so you'll want to subclass this for your particular case. It's fairly simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>setContent() — perform any processing on the content of the file. In my case, I needed to run it through drupal_json_decode() and grab the body text field, since the whole file was JSON representing a node.</li>
<li>getChunkCount() — process the file content to return a count of how many items for migration are contained in it.</li>
<li>getChunkIDs() — similar to getChunkCount(), but return IDs. You will probably end up using a common helper method for this and getChunkCount(), as they do the same sort of work. The IDs you return can be anything you like; in my case they were GUIDs. They are appended to the ID for the file to form the overall source ID.</li>
<li>getChunk() — given a chunk ID (one of the ones you provided in getChunkIDs()), return the actual data for that item. Again, you may want to use a common helper. In my case, here I merely returned the ID itself, since the images to migrate were on a remote server and accessed by their GUID.</li>
</ul>
<p>I submitted a patch to make it a bit easier to deal with the case where files might contain either one or many chunks (or even none): by default, a file providing only one chunk doesn't get to return a chunk ID, which wasn't working for my case. The patch (committed but not yet in a release) adds <a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/2550793">an option to override this</a> so you always know the ID of the chunk: in my case, the GUID for the image found inside the body text, which was always needed by the image migration code.</p>
<p>At the other end, I needed a custom subclass of MigrateItem to deal with the data returned by getChunk(). This just needs to implement getItem(), and it can pretty much return anything you like: this is the same source data item that your migration class gets to work with.</p>
<p>So to recap, as there's quite a few classes flying around helping one another here, we have MigrateListFiles which uses a custom MigrateContentParser implementation to extract items from the source data files, with possibly more than one item from a single file, and then MigrateSourceList uses MigrateListFiles along with a custom MigrateItem implementation.</p>
<p>The setup code in my migration's constructor then looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>    $parser = new CustomJSONBodyImagesParser();
    $list = new MigrateListFiles(
      // $list_dirs
      array($source_folder),
      // $base_dir
      $source_folder,
      // $file_mask
      '//',
      // $options
      array(),
      // MigrateContentParser $parser
      $parser
    );
    $item = new CustomImageGUIDItem();
    $this-&gt;source = new MigrateSourceList($list, $item, $fields);
</code></pre>
<p>The end result worked great, and the ability to rollback turned out to be very useful, when there turned out to be bad data here and there that needed to be cleaned up or skipped. But that's what always happens with migrations in my experience!</p></div>

            <div class="text-content clearfix field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>I have a standard format for patchnames: 1234-99.project.brief-description.patch, where 1234 is the issue number and 99 is the (expected) comment number. However, it involves two copy-pastes: one for the issue number, taken from my browser, and one for the project name, taken from my command line prompt.</p>
<p>Some automation of this is clearly possible, especially as I usually name my git branches 1234-brief-description. More automation is less typing, and so in true XKCD condiment-passing style, I've now written that script, which you can find on github as <a href="https://github.com/joachim-n/dorgpatch">dorgpatch</a>. (The hardest part was thinking of a good name, and as you can see, in the end I gave up.)</p>
<p>Out of the components of the patch name, the issue number and description can be deduced from the current git branch, and the project from the current folder. For the comment number, a bit more work is needed: but drupal.org now has a public API, so a simple REST request to that gives us data about the issue node including the comment count.</p>
<p>So far, so good: we can generate the filename for a new patch. But really, the script should take care of doing the diff too. That's actually the trickiest part: figuring out which branch to diff against. It requires a bit of git branch wizardry to look at the branches that the current branch forks off from, and some regular expression matching to find one that looks like a Drupal development branch (i.e., 8.x-4.x, or 8.0.x). It's probably not perfect; I don't know if I accounted for a possibility such as 8.x-4.x branching off a 7.x-3.x which then has no further commits and so is also reachable from the feature branch.</p>
<p>The other thing this script can do is create a tests-only patch. These are useful, and generally advisable on drupal.org issues, to demonstrate that the test not only checks for the correct behaviour, but also fails for the problem that's being fixed. The script assumes that you have two branches: the one you're on, 1234-brief-description, and also one called 1234-tests, which contains only commits that change tests.</p>
<p>The git workflow to get to that point would be:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create the branch 1234-brief-description
</li>
<li>Make commits to fix the bug
</li>
<li>Create a branch 1234-tests
</li>
<li>Make commits to tests (I assume most people are like me, and write the tests after the fix)
</li>
<li>Move the string of commits that are only tests so they fork off at the same point as the feature branch: git rebase --onto 8.x-4.x 1234-brief-description 1234-tests
</li>
<li>Go back to 1234-brief-description and do: git merge 1234-tests, so the feature branch includes the tests.
</li>
<li>If you need to do further work on the tests, you can repeat with a temporary branch that you rebase onto the tip of 1234-tests. (Or you can cherry-pick the commits. Or do cherry-pick with git rev-list, which is a trick I discovered today.)
</li>
</ol>
<p>Next step will be having the script make an interdiff file, which is a task I find particularly fiddly.</p>

            <div class="text-content clearfix field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>There's been a lot of discussion about how we need github-like features on d.org. Will we get them? There's definitely many improvements in the pipeline to the way our issue queues work. Whether we actually need to replicate github is another debate (and my take on it is that I don't think we do).</p>
<p>In the meantime, I think that it's possible to have a good collaborative workflow with what we have right now on drupal.org, with just the issue queue and patches, and git local branches. Here's what I've gradually refined over the years. It's fast, it helps you keep track of things, and it makes the most of git's strengths.</p>
<h2>A word on local branches</h2>
<p>Git's killer feature, in my opinion, is local branches. Local branches allow you to keep work on different issues separate, and they allow you to experiment and backtrack. To get the most out of git, you should be making small, frequent commits.</p>
<p>Whenever I do a presentation on git, I ask for a show of hands of who's ever had to bounce on CMD-Z in their text editor because they broke something that was working five minutes ago. Commit often, and never have that problem again: my rule of thumb is to commit any time that your work has reached a state where if subsequent changes broke it, you'd be dismayed to lose it.</p>
<h2>Starting work on an issue</h2>
<p>My first step when I'm working on an issue is obviously:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><code>&nbsp; git pull</code></div>
<p>This gets the current branch (e.g. 7.x, 7.x-2.x) up to date. Then it's a good idea to reload your site and check it's all okay. If you've not worked on core or the contrib project in question in a while, then you might need to run update.php, in case new commits have added updates.</p>
<p>Now start a new local branch for the issue:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><code>&nbsp; git checkout -b 123456-foobar-is-broken</code></div>
<p>I like to prefix my branch name with the issue number, so I can always find the issue for a branch, and find my work in progress for an issue. A description after that is nice, and as git has bash autocompletion for branch names, it doesn't get in the way. Using the issue number also means that it's easy to see later on which branches I can delete to unclutter my local git checkout: if the issue has been fixed, the branch can be deleted!</p>
<p>So now I can go ahead and start making commits. Because a local branch is private to me, I can feel free to commit code that's a total mess. So something like:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><code>&nbsp; dpm($some_variable_I_needed_to_examine);<br>&nbsp; /*<br>&nbsp; // Commented-out earlier approach that didn't quite work right.<br>&nbsp; $foo += $bar;<br>&nbsp; */<br>&nbsp; // Badly-formatted code that will need to be cleaned up.<br>&nbsp; if($badly-formatted_code) { $arg++; }</code></div>
<p>That last bit illustrates an important point: commit code before cleaning up. I've lost count of the number of times that I've got it working, and cleaned up, and then broken it because I've accidentally removed an important line that was lost among the cruft. So as soon as code is working, I make a commit, usually whose message is something like 'TOUCH NOTHING IT WORKS!'. Then, start cleaning up: remove the commented-out bits, the false starts, the stray code that doesn't do anything, in small commits of course. (This is where you find it actually does, and breaks everything: but that doesn't matter, because you can just revert to a previous commit, or even use git bisect.)</p>
<h2>Keeping up to date</h2>
<p>Core (or the module you're working on) doesn't stay still. By the time you're ready to make a patch, it's likely that there'll be new commits on the main development branch (with core it's almost certain). And before you're ready, there may be commits that affect your ongoing work in some way: API changes, bug fixes that you no longer need to work around, and so on.</p>
<p>Once you've made sure there's no work currently uncommitted (either use git stash, or just commit it!), do:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><code>git fetch<br>git rebase BRANCH</code></div>
<p>where BRANCH is the main development branch that is being committed to on drupal.org, such as 8.0.x, 7.x-2.x-dev, and so on.</p>
<p>(This is arguably one case where a local branch is easier to work with than a github-style forked repository.)</p>
<p>There's lots to read about rebasing elsewhere on the web, and some will say that rebasing is a terrible thing. It's not, when used correctly. It can cause merge conflicts, it's true. But here's another place where small, regular commits help you: small commits mean small conflicts, that shouldn't be too hard to resolve.</p>
<h2>Making a patch</h2>
<p>At some point, I'll have code I'm happy with (and I'll have made a bunch of commits whose log messages are 'clean-up' and 'formatting'), and I want to make a patch to post to the issue:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><code>&nbsp; git diff 7.x-1.x &gt; 123456.PROJECT.foobar-is-broken.patch</code></div>
<p>Again, I use the issue number in the name of the patch. Tastes differ on this. I like the issue number to come first. This means it's easy to use autocomplete, and all patches are grouped together in my file manager and the sidebar of my text editor.</p>
<h2>Reviewing and improving on a patch</h2>
<p>Now suppose Alice comes along, reviews my patch, and wants to improve it. She should make her own local branch:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><code>&nbsp; git checkout -b 123456-foobar-is-broken</code></div>
<p>and download and apply my patch:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><code>&nbsp; wget PATCHURL<br>&nbsp; patch -p1 &lt; 123456.PROJECT.foobar-is-broken.patch</code></div>
<p>(Though I would hope she has a bash alias for 'patch -p1' like I do. The other thing to say about the above is that while wget is working at downloading the patch, there's usually enough time to double-click the name of the patch in its progress output and copy it to the clipboard so you don't have to type it at all.)</p>
<p>And finally commit it to her branch. I would suggest she uses a commit message that describes it thus:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><code>&nbsp; git commit -m "joachim's patch at comment #1"</code></div>
<p>(Though again, I would hope she uses a GUI for git, as it makes this sort of thing much easier.)</p>
<p>Alice can now make further commits in her local branch, and when she's happy with her work, make a patch the same way I did. She can also make an interdiff very easily, by doing a git diff against the commit that represents my patch.</p>
<h2>Incorporating other people's changes to ongoing work</h2>
<p>All simple so far. But now suppose I want to fix something else (patches can often bounce around like this, as it's great to have someone else to spot your mistakes and to take turns with). My branch looks like it did at my patch. Alice's patch is against the main branch (for the purposes of this example, 7.x-1.x).</p>
<p>What I want is a new commit on the tip of my local branch that says 'Alice's changes from comment #2'. What I need is for git to believe it's on my local branch, but for the project files to look like the 7.x-1.x branch. With git, there's nearly always a way:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><code>&nbsp; git checkout 7.x-1.x .</code></div>
<p>Note the dot at the end. This is the filename parameter to the checkout command, which tells git that rather than switch branches, you want to checkout just the given file(s) while staying on your current branch. And that the filename is a dot means we're doing that for the entire project. The branch remains unchanged, but all the files from 7.x-1.x are checked out.</p>
<p>I can now apply Alice's patch:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><code>&nbsp; wget PATCHURL<br>&nbsp; patch -p1 &lt; 123456.2.PROJECT.foobar-is-broken.patch</code></div>
<p>(Alice has put the comment ID after the issue ID in the patch filename.)</p>
<p>When I make a commit, the new commit goes on the tip of my local branch. The commit diff won't look like Alice's patch: it'll look like the difference between my patch and Alice's patch: effectively, an interdiff. I now make a commit for Alice's patch:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><code>&nbsp; git commit -m "Alice's patch at comment #2"</code></div>
<p>I can make more changes, then do a diff as before, post a patch, and work on the issue advances to another iteration.</p>
<p>Here's an example of my local branch for an issue on Migrate I've been working on recently. You can see where I made a bunch of commits to clean up the documentation to get ready to make a patch. Following that is a commit for the patch the module maintainer posted in response to mine. And following that are a few further tweaks that I made on top of the maintainer's patch, which I then of course posted as another patch.</p>
<p><img src="sites/default/files/article/image/git-local-branch-issue-workflow.png" width="457" height="257" alt="A screenshot of a git GUI showing the tip of a local branch, with a commit for a patch from another user."></p>
<p>(Notice how in a local branch, I don't feel the need to type terribly accurately for my commit messages, or indeed be all that clear.)</p>
<h2>Improving on our tools</h2>
<p>Where next? I'm pretty happy with this workflow as it stands, though I think there's plenty of scope for making it easier with some git or bash aliases. In particular, applying Alice's patch is a little tricky. (Though the stumbling block there is that you need to know the name of the main development branch. Maybe pass the script the comment URL, and let it ask d.org what the branch of that issue is?)</p>
<p>Beyond that, I wonder if any changes can be made to the way git works on d.org. A sandbox per issue would replace the passing around of patch files: you'd still have your local branch, and merge in and push instead of posting a patch. But would we have one single branch for the issue's development, which then runs the risk of commit clashes, or start a new branch each time someone wants to share something, which adds complexity to merging? And finally, sandboxes with public branches mean that rebasing against the main project's development can't be done (or at least, not without everyone know how to handle the consequences). The alternative would be merging in, which isn't perfect either.</p>
<p>The key thing, for me, is to preserve (and improve) the way that so often on d.org, issues are not worked on by just one person. They're a ball that we take turns pushing forward (snowball, Sisyphean rock, take your pick depending on the issue!). That's our real strength as a community, and whatever changes we make to our toolset have to be made with the goal of supporting that.</p>

            <div class="text-content clearfix field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>Now I've finished the Big Monster Project of Doom that I've been on the last two years, I can talk more about some of the code that I wrote for it. I can also say what it was: it was a web application for activists to canvass the public for a certain recent national referendum (I'll let you guess which one).</p>
<p>One of the major modules I wrote was <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/entity_operations">Entity Operations</a> module. What began as a means to avoid repeating the same code each time I needed a new entity type soon became the workhorse for the whole application UI.</p>
<p>The initial idea was this: if you want a custom entity type, and you want a UI for adding, editing, and deleting entities (much like with nodes), then you have to build this all yourself: hook_menu() items, various entity callbacks, form builders (and validation and submit handlers) for the entity form and the delete confirmation form. (The <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/model">Model module</a> demonstrates this well.)</p>
<p>That's a lot of boilerplate code, where the only difference is the entity type's name, the base path where the entity UI sits, and the entity form builder itself (but even that can be generalized, as will be seen).</p>
<p>Faced with this and a project on which I knew from the start I was going to need a good handful of custom entities (for use with Microsoft Dynamics CRM, accessed with another custom module of mine, <a href="http://drupal.org/project/remote_entity">Remote Entity API</a>), I undertook to build a framework that would take away all the repetition.</p>
<p>An Entity UI is thus built by declaring:</p>
<ul>
<li>A base path (for nodes, this would be 'node'; we'll ignore the fact that in core, this path itself is a listing of content).</li>
<li>A list of subpaths to form the tabs, and the operation handler class for each one</li>
</ul>
<p>With this in hand, why stop at just the entity view and edit tabs? The operation handlers can output static content or forms: they can output anything. One of the most powerful enhancements I made to this early on was to write an operations handler that outputs a view. It's the same idea as the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/eva">EVA</a> module.</p>
<p>So for the referendum canvassing application, I had a custom Campaign entity, that functioned as an Organic Group, and had as UI tabs several different views of members, views of contacts in the Campaign's geographic area, views of Campaign group content (such as tasks and contact lists), and so on.</p>
<p>This approach proved very flexible and quick. The group content entities were themselves also built with this, so that, for example, Contact List entities had operations for a user to book the entity, input data, and release it when done working on it. These were built with custom operation handlers specific to the Contact List entity, subclassing the generic form operation handler.</p>
<p>An unexpected bonus to all this was how easy it was to expose form-based operations to Views Bulk Operations and Services (as 'targeted actions' on the entity). This allowed the booking and release operations to work in bulk on views, and also to be done via a mobile app over Services.</p>
<p>A final piece of icing on the cake was the addition of alternative operation handlers for entity forms that provide just a generic bare bones form that invokes Field API to attach field widgets. With these, the amount of code needed to build a custom entity type is reduced to just three functions:</p>
<ul>
<li>hook_entity_info(), to declare the entity type to Drupal core</li>
<li>hook_entity_operations_info(), to declare the operations that make up the UI</li>
<li><a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/2240921">callback_entity_access()</a>, which controls the access to the operations</li>
</ul>
<p>The module has a few further tricks up its sleeve. If you're using user permissions for your entities, there's a helper function to use in your hook_permission(), which creates permissions out of all the operations (so: 'edit foobar entities', 'book foobar entities', 'discombobulate foobar entities' and so on). The entity URI callback that Drupal core requires you to have can be taken care of by a helper callback which uses the entity's base path definition. There's a form builder that lets you easily embed form-based operations into the entity build, so that you can put the sort of operations that are single buttons ('publish', 'book', etc) on the entity rather than in a tab. And finally, the links to operation tabs can be added to a view as fields, allowing a list of entities with links to view, edit, book, discombobulate, and so on.</p>
<p>So what started as a way to simplify and remove repetitive code became a system for building a whole entity-based UI, which ended up powering the whole of the application.</p>
